Onesie App  
======

If you had the chance, what image would you send to a million people? This question is the premise of Onesie. 

Onesie is an image messaging lottery. Everyday we randomly allow one person to send an image to everyone that uses the app. If you're not
one of the lucky ones, you will instead get an image notification at 5 PM that means something huge to someone out there.

The app is currently live on the App Store:
